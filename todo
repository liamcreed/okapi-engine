TODO:

GOAL: 3D pixelart adventure souls slike psychedelic exploring experience (NOT GAME!)




general:
    create animation system
        armatture conain time?

    player scaling weird
    CLEAN UP CODE

    check if all keyframes are correct

    FIX: animation speed ding

    bring back 3rd person camera

    SHADING DOESNT WORK!!!

    GLTF parsing in seperate file (INITIAILZE ALL STRUCTS TO ZERO)

    shaders not inside renderer but inside game loop; 
    in renderer start loop through array of shaders and set matrices;
    when draw quad, model etc, specify what shader

    fix thing with freeing texture when texture data is from array it doesnt need to be free

    ADD COMMENTS


Math:
    - return matrix instead of multiplying and only multpily when necessery
    - multiply mat4 with a vector
    - dot product quat
    - more funcs for structs
    - dont multiply if matrix is mat4_new;
    - rotation on camera direction axis

Lighting:
    - lighting system multiple lights;
    - Shadows only for directtional light
    - Bloom
    - mist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qslBNLeSPUc

OPengl:
    - rework frambuffer system
    - uniform buffer matrices
    - geometry shader for skeletons
    - Framebuffer alpha transparency
    - vertex array attrubute type in function
    - inversing matrix 3D on the cpu
    - Instanced renderering
    
2D renderer:
    - QUAD batched
    - UI
    
GLTF:   
    - export gltf data as binary
    - Identical meshes
    - Lights
    - Mesh name identification for ECS
    
    
Window:
    - window resize    create framebuffer again;
    - scroll input
    - clean up
